# SimpleApi
This is a simple API I made for people who are beginning to understand JS and want to take their learning further.

Your .env file should contain PORT and MESSAGE, port is the port of the webserver, wheras message is the response you want to send to people who make requests to your api!

The api has 2 requests url's that can be added to, stock http://localhost or http://localhost/api , the stock one returns someone requested your server, wheras the api one returnes someone requested your api!
